I've installed UBUNTU 18.04 LTS on a 64 bit Virtual Machine as I was supposed to. 
Afterwards, following the installation process for Liquid Galaxy Core on LiquidGalaxyLAB's Github repo (https://github.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/liquid-galaxy), 
I executed the following command on the terminal: lg1$lg bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LiquidGalaxyLAB/liquid-galaxy/master/install.sh). 
The installation of Liquid Galaxy on the machine (as master) was a success: it installed the core and some additional packages like Google Earth Pro. 
After the reboot, even thoguh I was supossed to have some error, I was able to open Google Earth using two methods: 
	- From the “Show Applications” menu. 
	- Executing /home/lg/earth/builds/latest/google-earth-pro.sh
As seen in the attached screenshot.

[FB1]-Since I didn't know what to do, I have simply added firebase support for the html file, which allows a person to login from their google account
https://code-in-38575.firebaseapp.com/

[FB2]- login implemented

[FB3]-I have updated the code as specified
However, it now uses a push command which produces a key with each input. It is not possible to add items in a list without a key as that would cause problems during simultaneous input by multiple users

[FB4]- Also, as requested by you earlier, the site now only shows the countries saved by the user logged in and not all users. There is also an added alert box with the username of the user, each time he/she logs in.
One tiny suggestion is that since a lot of most participants on GCI would not know about HTML and Javascript, therefore you could maybe provide them with a function, like the one that I have built in main.js to allow them to dynamically update the countries on the site once they have read it from the database. Or instead you could give them small leading guidelines as to what they should do once they read the database

[FB5]- Also, regarding the last task where you had asked me to engage with the community more. And obviously while developing open source, community engagement is very important. In fact, I would go a step further and say that the open source community is built on the foundation of community engagement. I think that with open source, we all add a little bit to to something instead of inventing something from the ground up. As the saying goes, "we don't want to reinvent the wheel." Keeping this in mind, I had started the introductions thread on the google group in order to get to know everyone and work together. So far, it has been amazing :)

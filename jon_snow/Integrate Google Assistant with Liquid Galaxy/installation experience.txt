While most of the installation was rather smooth, I faced the following errors.
I think that since the time since the tutorial was written, the desgin of the firebase site has probablly chnaged becuase of which
1. There was no discover firebase option to start the database
2. The database initialised with rules which didn't allow read or write. So, I had to chnage the rules in order to make the code work
The second problem that I faced was that when I started the firebase site, there was no exisitng project with the name of my dialog flow agent
Therefore, I had to debug the code through the console in order to find out where I went wrong and finally corrected it by choosing the right project which appeared later on
The final problem that I had was that I was running this code on a windows system and while I was able to install npm and curl, the final bash script required a linux based operating system. So, i sideloaded ubuntu on my system
Also, to install firebase the instructions asks you to run npm install -g firebase-tools
However, firebase requires root permission in order to run because of which i instead ran the command "sudo npm install -g firebase-tools"

Overall, the experience was great. Especially when curiosity struck me and I read the documentation about Dialog Flow and how it's capability of natural language processing, Helps it to segregate countries and learn from examples.

Final webapp is located at https://github.com/aggarnav/Cms and the video is located at https://drive.google.com/open?id=18zGy3QFGeiWmjGjFLrBy2ubNhI_PQx7i
Either that link or this link should work https://drive.google.com/file/d/18zGy3QFGeiWmjGjFLrBy2ubNhI_PQx7i/view?usp=sharing

Also, you might notice that I have added an optional radius for the circle, and not added an option to add latitude, longitudes or length of sides for any other shape.

I used a python script to automatically download pictures from google photos. I then manually went through this collection to ensure that no error had seeped in. https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-uOgcEjGHX54e2M5_Tt2a3-op6vcWaug?usp=sharing

The pictures have also been filtered based on their copyright status and each picture can be used for commercial purposes

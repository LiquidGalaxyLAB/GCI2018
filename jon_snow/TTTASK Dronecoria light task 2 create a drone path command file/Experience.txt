Hi,
I have wrote the code using python and the dronekit python package which allows to control our drone. My experience with this installation was great. 
In fact, it was the first time that i controlled a drone albeit a simulation. Moreover, I had always wondered if radio signals was the only way that drones were controlled but this task opened my eyes to a lot of other mediums that could be used too.
I think that a drone can be a very powerfull tool especially because of its versatile sensors and ability to navigate difficult terrains. Thank you for uploading this task and giving me a chance to learn :) I look forward to doing a lot more

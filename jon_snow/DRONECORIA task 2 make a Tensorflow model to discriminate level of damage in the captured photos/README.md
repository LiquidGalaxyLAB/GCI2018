To test on a particular image run "python predict.py --path "path of image"
The data that I used to train the model was based on the pictures provided by you. I have to say that labelling the images in folders was a huge help. Since, the number of images were limited, I randomised images to create a larger training data-set
The following is a video of me training the model on google colab. The model was trained using 500 epochs and achieved an accuracy rate of up to 96%

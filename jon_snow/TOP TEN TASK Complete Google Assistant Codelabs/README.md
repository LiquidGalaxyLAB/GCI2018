So, I made a small google assistant action suing the information at the codelab link. It is a small interactive quiz on geography filled with sounds to engage the user. I think that this app can be integrated with the lgxedu android application, it provide youngsters with a fun and engaging way to learn more about geography. Moreover, the app could send question specific KML files to a liquid galaxy setup in order to engage the user even more and dynamically change the location being viewed on the liquid galaxy.

The link of one such sample screen recording is at https://1drv.ms/v/s!AlpyKCJf_9kb_UngaOzM9c7GUBx1. I didn't record all of the 14 questions which are randomly chosen from a larger dataset because that would have created a much larger video which would have been tougher to upload.

I am sorry didn't link didn't work, here's another link of the same file https://1drv.ms/v/s!AlpyKCJf_9kb_UlNdpcZzk8xMKh4 and in case this one doesn't work then here's a Google drive link https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WAg-b6vgw1N_m1wx11K4vlml9z-qBiIK/view?usp=drivesdk. I usually send the files on mail once the task is approved because that is the the final file. However, In case you want me to send all versions of the files. Then I can do that too :)

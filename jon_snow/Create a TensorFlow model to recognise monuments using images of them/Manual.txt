This is a retinanet network based on a resnet 50 backbone. The implementation is based on the keras implementation of retinanet by u/fizyr.
I have already trained the model after 450 epochs on google collaboratory. The resulting snapshot is stored in snapshots.
To run this model
1. run examples/ResNet50RetinaNet.ipynb with any image of your choice
	considering that you are an organzation engaged in mapping area. I have also included object detection along with object recognition due to which you will have a bounding box surrounding the recognised object rather than just a probability score.
To further train this model
1. run keras_retinanet/bin/train.py
	using the snapshot provided in the folder snapshot as a starting point
	the script has a list of all the arguments that it can take
2. to train the model you would need additional images with two csv files
3. the first csv file would have annotations in the format, path/to/image.jpg,x1,y1,x2,y2,class_name
4. the second csv file would have labels in the format class_name,id

Note- due to a lack of available datasets, I had to create my own datatset and manually create bounding boxes due to which the model might have overfitted to the dataset provided
